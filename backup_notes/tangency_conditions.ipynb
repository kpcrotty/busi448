    "We often discuss the efficient frontier for risky assets, but we can also consider the efficient frontier for the set of $N+1$ assets comprised of $N$ risky assets and the risk-free asset.  If it exists, the tangency portfolio is the efficient portfolio comprised solely of risky assets. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let $w_1,w_2,\\dots,w_N$ denote portfolio weights in the risky assets.  Since the portfolio is fully invested, the allocation to the risk-free asset is $1-\\sum_{i=1}^N w_i$.  The portfolio variance of the $N+1$ asset portfolio is $w'Vw$ where $w'=[w_1\\, w_2\\, \\dots\\,w_N]$.\n",

    "We can view the terms on the left-hand side of the equations above as the contributions of each asset to overall portfolio risk.  The equations thus say that the ratio of an asset's excess return to its contribution to overall portfolio risk is the same across all assets for the optimal combination of risky assets.  If this were not the case for some pair of assets, then it would be possible to create a more efficient portfolio by investing a little more in the asset with the higher ratio and a little less in the asset with the lower ratio.\n"
