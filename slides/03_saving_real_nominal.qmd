## Where are we?
**Last time**:

::: {.nonincremental}
- Saving for retirement
:::

. . . 

**Today**:

::: {.nonincremental}
- Real and nominal cash flows and rates
- Uncertainty in returns
:::


# Saving for retirement with inflation
## Saving for retirement with inflation
- Now assume we consume a constant **real** amount in retirement
  - our standard of living will be unchanged each year
- Can finance with constant nominal or real saving
- Assume a nominal rate of 5% and inflation of 2% each year

. . .

**Q1: How much do we need to save each year if saving a constant real amount?**

. . . 

**Q2: How much do we need to save each year if saving a constant nominal amount?**


## Real and Nominal Cash Flows

What is the relationship between real and nominal cash flows at a point in time $t$?

. . . 

$$ \text{Nominal CF}_t = \text{Real CF}_t \cdot (1+\text{inflation})^t. $$

. . .

What does the above look like?

## Real and Nominal Discount Rates

What is the relationship between real and nominal rates?

. . .

$$ 1+ \text{nominal rate} = (1+\text{real rate})(1+\text{inflation}).$$

- Nominal cash flows are discounted/compounded using nominal rates.
- Real cash flows are discounted/compounded using real rates.


# Uncertain returns

## Simulating random returns

We can easily simulate random returns in Python

``` {.python}
from scipy.stats import norm
norm.rvs(loc=0.03, scale=0.1, size=50)
```

- What does the distribution of ending balances look like if we save $32,000 for 30 years (in real terms) and withdraw $100,000 for 20 years? (both in real terms)
  - Assume real returns are normally distributed with mean of 3% and standard deviation of 10%.
- How often do we run out of money?!?


# For next time: Returns, returns, and more returns...
