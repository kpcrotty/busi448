# Taxation Primer

## Tax Brackets

**Progressive taxation**: income is taxed at higher rates as more is earned

- The first dollar earned is taxed less than the last dollar earned.

- **Marginal** tax rate refers to the tax rate owed on next dollar you earn.

## Deductions shield income from taxation

- Some retirement savings are tax-deductible

- Standard deductions vs. itemized deductions
  - Single filer: $12,950
  - Married filing jointly: $25,900

- Itemized deductions
  - Mortgage interest
  - State and local taxes (SALT)
  - Charitable contributions

## General schedule

Gross Income

-Tax-Deductible Savings Contributions

[-Other Deductible Items]{.underline}

=Adjusted Gross Income (AGI)

[-Standard or Itemized Deduction]{.underline}

=Taxable Income

- Tax is calculated based on taxable income and filing status

## Example 

- Consider a single investor earning $65,000 per year.  
- Assume they take the standard deduction of $12,590.
- Under the 2022 tax rates & brackets, what is the investor's tax bill if they do not have any other deductions?
- What is the investor's tax bill if they have contributed $6,000 to a traditional IRA?

## Taxes and investments

- Investments are made in the hopes of generating income or price appreciation.  
- The source of the return can impact the taxes owed.
- Interest income is taxed at ordinary income rates.
- Capital gains are taxed at different capital gains rates.
  - Is holding period short- or long-term?
  - Limits on deductibility of capital losses
  - Gain is calculated relative to your **cost basis**

# Tax-advantaged Accounts

<!-- The following is partially based off of Scholes, Wolfson, Erickson, Maydew, and Shevlin's Taxes and Business Strategy text.   -->

## Our benchmark

- We will explore how account taxation can affect the future value of investments.
- Our benchmark will be an investment with no tax advantages in which any gains are taxed immediately at ordinary income rates.

## Some terminology and assumptions

We will assume 2 sets of tax rates:

1. Ordinary income rates $\tau_{oi}$ 
2. Capital gains rates $\tau_{cg}$.  


- We will assume constant tax rates from time $t=0$ to time $t=T-1$ before changing to new rates at time $T$
  - individual's tax brackets may change in somewhat predictable ways

- 4 possible tax rates: $\tau_{oi,0}$, $\tau_{oi,T}$, $\tau_{cg,0}$, $\tau_{cg,T}$.

## Tax Treatment #1

- No tax benefits
- Gains are taxed immediately at ordinary income rates

. . . 

$$FV_1 = \Pi_{t=1}^T \left(1+r_t(1-\tau_{oi,t})\right) \,. $$

- Examples: bank accounts, money market accounts, and non-tax-advantaged bonds

## Tax treatment #2

- Non-deductible IRA
- Contributions are in after-tax dollars
- Taxation on gains is deferred until withdrawal at which time they are taxed as *ordinary income*

. . . 

$$ \begin{align*}
FV_2 =& \Pi_{t=1}^T (1+r_t) - \tau_{oi,T} \left[\Pi_{t=1}^T (1+r_t) - 1\right] \\
=& (1-\tau_{oi,T})\Pi_{t=1}^T (1+r_t) + \tau_{oi,T}  
\end{align*}
$$

## Tax treatment #3

- Non-dividend stock
- Investment made with after-tax dollars
- Taxation on gains is deferred until sale at which time they are taxed as *capital gains*

. . . 

$$ \begin{align*}
FV_3 =& \Pi_{t=1}^T (1+r_t) - \tau_{cg,T} \left[\Pi_{t=1}^T (1+r_t) - 1\right] \\
=& (1-\tau_{cg,T})\Pi_{t=1}^T (1+r_t) + \tau_{cg,T}  
\end{align*}
$$


## Tax treatment #4

- Roth IRA or a 529 college savings plan
- Contributions are made using after-tax dollars and earnings are tax-exempt

. . . 

A dollar of after-tax investment turns into $$FV_4 = \Pi_{t=1}^T \left(1+r_t\right) \,. $$


## Tax treatment #5

- Traditional IRA or 401(k)/403(b) retirement plan. 
- Contributions are made using pre-tax dollars (that is, contributions are tax deductible)
- Earnings are tax-deferred $\rightarrow$ withdrawals taxed at ordinary income rates
  - withdrawals of both initial investment and gains

## Tax treatment #5 (cont'd)
- Because the contribution is tax deductible, you save $\tau_{oi,0}$ of taxes that would have otherwise been paid.
- The after-tax cost upon contribution is thus $1-\tau_{oi,0}.$
- The investment account grows to a time $T$ value of $\Pi_{t=1}^T \left(1+r_t\right)$ which is all taxed at withdrawal generating an after-tax time $T$ value of $(1-\tau_{oi,T})\Pi_{t=1}^T \left(1+r_t\right)$.  

## Tax treatment #5 (cont'd)

After-tax return (after-tax FV/after-tax contribution): $$FV_5 = \frac{(1-\tau_{oi,T})\Pi_{t=1}^T \left(1+r_t\right)}{1-\tau_{oi,0}}$$

## Traditional vs. Roth IRAs

**If $\tau_{oi,0}=\tau_{oi,T}$, traditional and Roth IRAs are equivalent on an after-tax basis.**

- Roth IRAs are preferred if an investor's tax rate is expected to be higher at withdrawal.
  - Better to pay taxes at low rate today
- Traditional IRAs are preferred if an investor's tax rate is expected to be lower at withdrawl.
  - Better to shield taxes at high rate today


## Asset location vs. asset allocation

**Asset allocation**: the choice of how much of each asset to hold

**Asset location**: the choice of where to locate different asset classes if different tax-advantaged accounts are available.

- This is a challenging problem!
- Investors with different expected tax rates may come to different allocation and location decisions.

- Rule of thumb: Hold more heavily taxed assets (corporate and Treasury bonds) in tax-deferred accounts and lightly-taxed assets (stocks) in taxable accounts


# Tax-advantaged Securities

## Mortgages

- For households, mortgage interest is tax-deductible, up to some limits.
  - Deduction reduces taxable income
  - Tax savings is: $$\tau_{\text{marginal}} \cdot \text{Deductible Mortgage Interest}$$

## 2022 tax year
- Mortgage interest expense on principal up to $750,000 is tax deductible.
- Taxpayer must itemize deductions rather than take the standard deduction
  - Single filer: $12,950
  - Married filing jointly: $25,900

## Example

- The annual interest expense for a $500,000 mortgage with a 5% interest rate is $24,832.47 in the first year.
- For an investor with a 24% marginal tax rate and a $12,950 standard deduction, what is the incremental value of itemizing deductions?

## Municipal Bonds

- Municipal bonds: issued by states and municipalities
- In an investor's home state, muni coupons and original issue discount (OID) are exempt from state income tax
  - US treasury bonds are also exempt from state and local taxes
- Some munis qualify as exempt from federal income tax
- Munis are tax-exempt only at issuance

## Muni yields

- Munis are primarily held by individuals (in the issuing state)
- These investors accept a lower yield than they would for a comparable taxable bond.

# Other tax topics

## ETFs versus mutual funds

- ETFs are generally more tax-efficient than mutual funds.
- Flows in and out of mutual funds may generate sales of underlying assets in the mutual fund.
  - Resulting capital gains are passed on to the fund investor
- ETF investors thus are able to substantially defer capital gains taxation

## Roth IRAs and skewed returns

- Withdrawals from Roth IRAs do not incur any tax.
- This tax treatment can be extraordinarily valuable for highly skewed assets.
- A famous example is Peter Thiel (PayPal founder and venture capitalist)
- Thiel's Roth IRA is over $5 billion!
- Congress will likely cap the maximum balance that will be tax-free
- Paying attention to taxes pays...sometimes big!
