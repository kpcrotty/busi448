## Where are we?
**Last time**:

::: {.nonincremental}
- More interest rate risk
- Convexity
- Callable bonds
:::

. . . 

**Today**:

::: {.nonincremental}
- Credit risk
- Credit ratings
:::


## Credit risk

**Credit risk**: the risk that the issuer of a bond (borrower) will not pay back all or part of the promised cash flows. 
<br/>
<br/>

. . .

Issuers with credit risk:

- Corporations
- Households
- Governments



# Credit ratings

## Investment-grade versus high-yield {.smaller}

- **Higher ratings generally mean less default risk.**
- There are + and - notches for the ratings above.

## Purposes of ratings
<br/><br/>

- Proxy for credit risk 
- Regulation
  - Ex: Capital req's are often tied to ratings
- Contracting
  - Downgrades may trigger contract clauses


# Modeling corporate credit

## Modeling corporate credit

- Why would a 5-year IBM bond have a different yield from a 5-year AAPL bond?
  - industry differences
  - firm-specific information
  - capital structure

. . . 

Let's take a look at some data.

## Regression analysis #1

$$ y_{it} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \cdot \text{ttm}_{it} + \beta_2 \cdot \text{rating}_{it} + \varepsilon_{it} $$

- rating is numeric 1, 2, 3, ...
  - we might want to do this differently


## Average yield by ratings class

- Let's calculate the average yield within each ratings class.
- What should we expect to see as credit ratings decline?

. . .

Code to average by ratings class:
``` {.python}
df.groupby('RATING_CAT')['ytm'].aggregate(['mean','count'])
```



## Regression analysis #2

- It's possible that yield-ratings relation will be non-linear.
- One way to capture this is to add dummy variables for each ratings bin:

. . . 

$$ y_{it} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \cdot \text{ttm}_{it} + \sum_{k=AA,A,...} \beta_k \cdot 1[\text{rating}_{it}=k] + \varepsilon_{it} $$

. . .

Code to generate dummy variables:
``` {.python}
rating_dummies = pd.get_dummies(df.RATING_CAT)
df = df.merge(rating_dummies,left_index=True,right_index=True)
```

## Regression versus within-class averages
<br/>

- How do the within-class averages compare to the dummy-variable regressions?
- NOTE: this would be *exact* if we hadn't controlled for time-to-maturity.


## For a risky bond, YTM $\neq$ expected return!

- YTM: IRR of a bond based on **promised** cash flows.

. . .

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width=50%}
![](../images/corp_bond_tree.png)
:::
::: {.column width=50%}
$$ \begin{align*}
E[r] =& (1-p_{\text{default}})\cdot YTM \\
     &+ p_{\text{default}}\cdot r_{\text{default}}
\end{align*} $$
:::
::::

**YTM overestimates expected returns for risky bonds.**


# Credit Spreads
## Yield Spreads

- Bonds with credit risk are often quoted as an interest rate spread relative to some benchmark rate
  - Treasury of same maturity or a interest rate swap

. . . 

$$ \text{Spread} = YTM_{\text{risky}} - YTM_{\text{maturity-matched risk-free}}  $$

. . . 

- Spread is related to the default probability times the expected loss given default (in risk-neutral terms).
  - $\uparrow$ in probability of default increases spread
  - $\uparrow$ in expected loss given default increases spread

# CDS
## Credit default swaps

**Credit default swaps**: an insurance contract against default by a risky borrower


*Two cash flow streams*:

1. CDS buyer pays CDS seller a period payment (**premium**)

2. If firm defaults, the CDS seller pays the buyer the bond's par value less the bond's market value.

- CDS contracts are intended to make an investor in an issuer's debt whole in the case of default.

## CDS cash flows
![](../images/cds_cashflows.png)

## No-arbitrage relation

- There is a no-arbitrage relation between a corporate bond, risk-free debt, and a CDS.
- The cash flows from owning a risky bond + CDS should be the same as owning a risk-free bond.
- The **Law of One Price** says that two portfolios that generate the same cash flows in the future should have the same price today!
  - This implies that: 

. . . 

  $$ \text{Bond Yield Spread} = \text{CDS spread} $$

<!-- +--------------------+-------------------------+--------------------+
| Risky Bond         | Risk-free Bond          |    CDS             |
+:==================:+:=======================:+:==================:+
|  $R$               |        100              |      0             |    
+--------------------+-------------------------+--------------------+ -->

## Cash flows with and without default
Let $R<100$ denote the recovery for a defaulted bond.


With default, the payoffs are:

| Risky Bond          | Risk-free Bond      | CDS                 |
|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
|        R            | 100                 | 100-R               |

. . . 

With no default, the payoffs are:

| Risky Bond          | Risk-free Bond      | CDS                 |
|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
|        100          | 100                 | 0               |


- Risky Bond + CDS provides $100 either way!

## Uses of CDS

- Hedging of credit risk by long bond investors
- Speculation
  - buy CDS if you think an issuer will default
  - sell CDS to collect premiums

## Economic debates

- *Empty creditor problem*:
  - is it good for bondholders to *not* have exposure to firm's credit risk?
  - will these investors monitor effectively?
- *Counterparty risk*:
  - CDS writers could be on the hook for a large amount in the event an issuer defaults.  Will they be good for it?
- *Legal questions*: 
  - What constitutes a default?
