# Economics of Asset Management

## Efficient Markets Theory

**Market efficiency**: Prices reflect all available information.  

. . .

The "forms" of efficiency differ only in their definition of "all":

- **Weak**: Prices reflect all historical trade data (past prices, trends, volumes, moving averages)
- **Semi-strong**: Prices reflect all publicly available information (SEC filings, news reports, etc.)
- **Strong**: Prices reflect all relevant information (public and private).

## Grossman-Stiglitz Paradox

- Suppose all information is already reflected in prices
- If the cost of gathering information is large relative to the benefits that can be derived from trading on that information, investors will have no incentive to perform the necessary analysis.
- If all information is reflected in prices, then there is nothing to be gained from stock analysis.
- If no one has incentive to gather/analyze information, no one will be able to trade on said information.
- If no one can trade on the information, then how does the information get incorporated in the price?  

## Implications for market efficiency

The same intuition, in principle, applies to semi-strong form and weak-form efficiency:

- If there is nothing to be gained from fundamental analysis, no one will do it.
- If there is nothing to be gained from technical analysis, no one will do it.

. . .

What are the implications for market efficiency?


## Equilibrium for Asset Management

Consider a world where

1. investors try to invest with skilled managers
2. managers face decreasing returns to scale.

- Where will investors move their money?
- What should happen to the performance (*in returns*) of skilled managers over time?
- What will happen to underperforming funds?



# Alphas

## How should we evaluate managers?

- One way: $$ \text{Abnormal Return} = r_{\text{portfolio}} - r_{\text{benchmark}}$$

- How should we choose the benchmark?

## Recall the Market Model Regression

$$ r_{\text{portfolio},t} - r_{f,t} = \alpha_p + \beta_p (r_{m,t} - r_{f,t}) + \varepsilon_{p,t} $$

## Alpha is a benchmark-adjusted average return! {.smaller}

$$ \alpha_p = \frac{1}{T} \sum_{t=1}^T [r_{\text{portfolio}} - r_{f,t} - \hat{\beta}_p \cdot (r_{m,t} - r_{f,t})] $$

where the benchmark return is:

$$ r_{\text{benchmark},t} = r_{f,t} + \hat{\beta}_p \cdot (r_{m,t} - r_{f,t}) $$


## Factor-model alphas {.smaller}

The alpha from the Fama-French-Carhart model $$ r_{p,t} - r_{f,t} = \alpha_p + \beta_p (r_{m,t} - r_{f,t}) + s_p SMB_t + h_p HML_t + m_p WML_t+ \varepsilon_{p,t} $$ is also an average benchmark-adjusted return.  

. . . 

The benchmark return is:
$$ r_{f,t} + \hat{\beta}_p \cdot (r_{m,t} - r_{f,t}) + \hat{s}_p SMB_t + \hat{h}_p HML_t + \hat{m}_p WML_t. $$ 

. . . 

The benchmark-adjusted (active) return each period is:
$$ \alpha_p + \varepsilon_{p,t}.$$


## Today's first notebook

- We will estimate alphas for a large sample of actively managed mutual funds.

- What do you think the distribution of alphas will look like?
  - *Draw a histogram with the outcome variable being $\alpha$*

- Can we predict funds leaving the sample?

- How important is survivorship bias?

## Today's second notebook

- Let's assess the performance of a set of momentum ETFs.


# Attribution Analysis

## Understanding performance

- It is often useful to explain the source of a fund's performance.  Such analysis is called **attribution analysis**

- We will consider attribution analysis based on the Fama-French-Carhart model.

## FFC return components

We can write a portfolio's return each period as the sum of:

1. Active return: $\hspace{4.2em}\hat{\alpha}_p + \varepsilon_{p,t}$
2. Market benchmark: $\hspace{0.5em}r_{f,t} + \hat{\beta}_p \cdot (r_{m,t} - r_{f,t})$
3. Size exposure:    $\hspace{4.0em}\hat{s}_p  \cdot SMB_t$
4. Value/growth exposure: $\hspace{0.5em}\hat{h}_p  \cdot HML_t$
5. Momentum exposure: $\hspace{1.0em}\hat{m}_p  \cdot WML_t$


## Today's third notebook

Let's run an attribution analysis for a fund by plotting the cumulative returns of each component over time.


# Market Timing

## Asset management skill

How can asset managers earn their fees?

- They may be good at picking stocks that will perform well in the future
- They may be good at timing the overall market.

## Testing for Market Timing Ability

If we plot fund excess returns versus market excess returns, what should the shape of scatter plot look like for a successful market timer?

## Henriksson-Merton Model {.smaller}

Consider the following model:
$$ r_{p,t} - r_{f,t} = \alpha_p + b_p (r_{m,t} - r_{f,t}) + c_p (r_{m,t} - r_{f,t})^+ + \varepsilon_{p,t} $$

where $(r_{m,t} - r_{f,t})^+$ equals the market excess return if it is positive, and zero otherwise.

. . .

What should be true of $c_p$ for successful market timers?

## Today's fourth notebook

- Let's look at some examples of good and bad market timing. 

- How does market-timing impact market-model alphas?
