## Primary versus secondary markets

- Primary: an issuing institution is interacting with the market and accessing capital
- Secondary: trades are generally between any interested party


## Types of Markets

- Limit order book trading (continuous)
- Over-the-counter markets (dealer markets)
- Call markets

## Limit order book markets

- Continuous markets: trades can occur at any time when the market is open
- A **limit order** is an order with a price specified.
  - Buy at price of x or less
  - Sell at price of x or more
  - If not immediately executable, it goes into the "book."
  - Has *execution* risk
- **Market orders** are orders to trade "at market," taking whatever price is available.
  - Has *price* risk
- Your broker is required to route your executable order to the venue offering the best price.

. . .

Examples:

- Equity market intraday trading (NYSE, Nasdaq)
- Futures, options, FX markets

## Bid-ask spread

- The price on a limit sell order is called an ask or offer price.
- The price on a limit buy order is called a bid.
- The best (lowest) ask and best (highest) bid are called the inside quotes.
- The difference between the best ask and the best bid is called the bid-ask spread or bid-offer spread.


## Example of a limit order book

![](../images/LOB.png)

The bid-ask spread is 180.02--180.03.

## {background-iframe="https://www.cboe.com/us/equities/market_statistics/book_viewer/" background-interactive="True"}


## Price impact

TBD



## Order priority

- Most trading venues use *price priority* to rank orders
  - Highest-priced buy orders get preference.
  - Lowest-priced sell orders get preference.

- Next is usually *time priority*
  - Orders placed first get preference.

- Concerns about execution risk lead to traders attempting to jump to the front of the line.


## Over-the-counter markets (dealer markets)

- Dealers and other traders are linked electronically.
- Characterized by search costs of finding a suitable counterparty

. . .

Examples include secondary trading in:

- corporate bonds
- government bonds
- money market instruments
- some equities


## Call markets
- Markets for some assets are called periodically, at which point trade occurs.
- The price-setting mechanism is some form of an auction.

. . .

Examples:

- Gov't bond auctions
- open/close for equity markets
- intraday for low-activity equities (sporadic call auctions)

## {background-iframe="https://www.treasurydirect.gov/auctions/announcements-data-results/" background-interactive="True"}


## Institutional trading

- Mutual funds etc. typically execute trades over several days, trading a small amount at a time, to minimize the price impacts of their trades.
  - Brokers provide algorithms optimized to minimize price impacts.
- High frequency trading (HFT) is a different kind of automated trading.
  - HFTs look for opportunities that may only exist for only a millisecond and only earn a penny a share or less.

## Internalization and payment for order flow 

- Retail orders are primarily executed on Alternative Trading Systems rather than the limit order book.
- Your broker/dealer may execute your order itself, to earn the bid-ask spread.
- Or your broker may send your order to another institution in exchange for a "kickback" of part of the spread.
- You are nevertheless supposed to get the National Best Bid or Offer (NBBO).

## Transparency

- **Transparency**: what and when information is available
- **Pre-trade** transparency
  - indicative orders visible (prices & quantities)
- **Post-trade** transparency
  - trade information visible (prices & quantities)

## Transparency across markets
Different markets provide differing levels of transparency.

- Some markets only display top of the book (best bid/offer or top N)
- Others show entire LOB 

- Equity and options markets are fairly transparent
- Corporate bond markets are less transparent, but have become more so.

## Knowledge of most recent pricing is valuable:

## Liquidity

**Liquidity** is the ease with which one can convert an asset into cash.

- Can you sell the asset quickly?
- Can you sell it with little loss in value?

Examples:

- Treasury bills and index ETFs are liquid assets
- Corporate bonds, private equity, and real estate are illiquid assets










## Leverage 

**Leverage** is investing borrowed money.

- The return, good or bad, on every $1 of your own money is amplified.

## Example 

- Initial capital to invest of $100,000

- Borrow $50,000

- Buy $50,000 of stocks

. . .

+---------------+--------+---------------+--------+
| Assets                 | Liab/Eq                |
+:==============+=======:+:==============+=======:+
| Stocks        |150,000 | Debt          | 50,000 |
|               |        | Equity        |100,000 |
+---------------+--------+---------------+--------+
| Total         |150,000 | Total         |150,000 |
+---------------+--------+---------------+--------+

- Leverage ratio $=\frac{\text{Assets}}{\text{Equity}}$
- Example is levered 1.5 to 1
- More jargon: 50% leverage

## One possible future

Suppose: 
- the stocks go up 10%
- you're charged 2% interest on the loan (rolled into the debt balance)

+---------------+--------+---------------+--------+
| Assets                 | Liab/Eq                |
+:==============+=======:+:==============+=======:+
| Stocks        |165,000 | Debt          | 51,000 |
|               |        | Equity        |114,000 |
+---------------+--------+---------------+--------+
| Total         |165,000 | Total         |165,000 |
+---------------+--------+---------------+--------+

. . .

- The return is 14% (114,000/100,000-1).

- You made 10% plus one half of (10% minus 2%) $= 0.10 + 0.5(0.10-0.02) = 0.14$
- "one-half" because you borrowed 50%.

## Levered return

Let $w = \frac{\text{Debt}}{\text{Initial Equity}}$.

Levered portfolio return is:
$$ w \cdot r_{\text{borrow}} + (1 + w) \cdot r_{\text{stock}} $$

. . .

We can rewrite this as:
$$ r_{\text{stock}} + w \cdot (r_{\text{stock}} - r_{\text{borrow}})\,.$$

. . .

The return in the example is:
$$ 0.10 + 0.5(0.10-0.02) = 0.14$$

## Another possible future

- Suppose the stocks fell by 10%.
- You lose 10% plus one half of ($-$ 10% $-$ 2% ).
- So, your loss is 16% on your $100,000 investment.

. . . 

+---------------+--------+---------------+--------+
| Assets                 | Liab/Eq                |
+:==============+=======:+:==============+=======:+
| Stocks        |135,000 | Debt          | 51,000 |
|               |        | Equity        | 84,000 |
+---------------+--------+---------------+--------+
| Total         |135,000 | Total         |135,000 |
+---------------+--------+---------------+--------+

- Check: 84,000/100,000 -1 = -16%.

## The good and the bad

- You always make the stock return plus the fraction borrowed times (stock return minus borrowing rate).
- With 50% leverage and a 2% interest charge, 

. . .

$$+10\text{%} \rightarrow +14\text{%}$$

. . .

$$-10\text{%} \rightarrow -16\text{%}$$


## Levered S&P Returns

## Margin

**Margin**: borrowing from your broker to purchase securities

- Percent margin = $\frac{\text{Equity}}{\text{Total Asset Value}}$

- **Initial margin** requirement set by the Fed's Reg T: 50%
  - Broker may set a higher initial margin requirement

- **Maintenance margin** requirement set by broker
  - Protects broker agains default by borrower if asset values drop.


## Example with margin 

Initial balance sheet

+---------------+--------+----------------------+--------+
| Assets                 | Liab/Eq                       |
+:==============+=======:+:=====================+=======:+
| Stocks        |150,000 | Margin loan          | 50,000 |
|               |        | Equity               |100,000 |
+---------------+--------+----------------------+--------+
| Total         |150,000 | Total                |150,000 |
+---------------+--------+----------------------+--------+

. . .

$$
\begin{align*}
\text{Percent Margin} &= \frac{\text{Equity}}{\text{Total Asset Value}} \\
&= \frac{100,000}{150,000}  \\
&= 66.67\% 
\end{align*}
$$ 

## Example with price drop of 10%

Balance sheet after stocks drop by 10% (and margin interest of 2% rolled into loan)

+---------------+--------+----------------------+--------+
| Assets                 | Liab/Eq                       |
+:==============+=======:+:=====================+=======:+
| Stocks        |135,000 | Margin loan          | 51,000 |
|               |        | Equity               | 84,000 |
+---------------+--------+----------------------+--------+
| Total         |135,000 | Total                |135,000 |
+---------------+--------+----------------------+--------+


. . .

$$
\begin{align*}
\text{Percent Margin} &= \frac{\text{Equity}}{\text{Total Asset Value}} \\
&= \frac{84,000}{135,000}  \\
&= 62.22\% 
\end{align*}
$$ 

## Margin Calls

A **margin call** occurs when the percent margin falls below the maintenance margin set by the broker.

- Suppose the maintenance margin on the account in our example is 35%.
- How much could the stock value drop before a margin call occurs? (Ignore the interest expense on the margin loan.)

. . .

A margin call occurs when:
$$ \frac{\text{Equity}}{\text{Total Asset Value}} < \text{Maintenance Margin}\,.$$

## Margin Calls

- $S_0$ = initial stock value
- $L$ = margin loan amount
- $MM$ = maintenance margin percentage
- $r$ = stock return

. . .

A margin call occurs when:
$$ \frac{S_0(1+r) - L}{S_0(1+r)} < MM\,.$$

. . .

Solving for $r$:
$$ r < \frac{L}{S_0(1-MM)} - 1.$$ 

## Example

Margin call occurs if stock return is less than:

$$r < \frac{50,000}{150,000(1-0.35)} - 1 = -48.7\%$$


. . .

+---------------+--------+----------------------+--------+
| Assets                 | Liab/Eq                       |
+:==============+=======:+:=====================+=======:+
| Stocks        | 75,000 | Margin loan          | 50,000 |
|               |        | Equity               | 25,000 |
+---------------+--------+----------------------+--------+
| Total         | 75,000 | Total                | 75,000 |
+---------------+--------+----------------------+--------+
$$\text{Percent Margin} = \frac{25,000}{75,000} = 33.3\% $$



## Margin Loan Rates

- It pays to shop around.
- Interactive Brokers charges
  - <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/FEDFUNDS">Fed Funds rate</a> plus 1.5% on the first $100,000.
  - and falling further after that.
- <a href="https://www.fidelity.com/trading/margin-loans/margin-rates">Fidelity rate schedule</a>


## Short-selling

- It is possible to sell before you buy.

- You need to borrow the asset you want to sell and return it later.

- This is called selling short or shorting.

- Hope is to reverse order of "buy low-sell high" maxim

. . .

Some jargon:
- Long = own something (asset)
- Short = owe something (liability)
- Cover = buying asset after shorting

## Example #1

- Borrow and sell 100 shares of ABC, which is trading at $60
- ABC drops to $40 and you buy back and return the shares (cover the short).  
- You bought at $40 and sold at $60, so you made $20 per share.
- Risk is that ABC $\uparrow$ and you have to buy back at more than $60

## Margin requirements

- The risk in short-selling is a price *increase*
- Brokers require the cash proceeds and additional margin as a buffer against this risk.
- Reg T: accounts must have 150% of short sale value at initiation
  - 100% comes from the short proceeds
  - add'l percent margin = $\frac{\text{Equity}}{\text{Value of Short Position}}$

## Margin example: short position

Initial balance sheet

+-------------------------+--------+--------------------+--------+
| Assets                           | Liab/Eq                     |
+:========================+=======:+:===================+=======:+
| Short Proceeds          |  6,000 | Short ABC          |  6,000 |
| Margin Assets           |  3,000 | Equity             |  3,000 |
+-------------------------+--------+--------------------+--------+
| Total                   |  9,000 | Total              |  9,000 |
+-------------------------+--------+--------------------+--------+

. . . 

$$\text{Percent Margin} = \frac{3,000}{6,000} = 50\% $$

## Margin example: short position
Suppose price rises to $70:


+-------------------------+--------+--------------------+--------+
| Assets                           | Liab/Eq                     |
+:========================+=======:+:===================+=======:+
| Short Proceeds          |  6,000 | Short ABC          |  7,000 |
| Margin Assets           |  3,000 | Equity             |  2,000 |
+-------------------------+--------+--------------------+--------+
| Total                   |  9,000 | Total              |  9,000 |
+-------------------------+--------+--------------------+--------+

. . .


$$\text{Percent Margin} = \frac{2,000}{7,000} = 28.6\% $$

## When does a margin call occur?

A margin call occurs when:
$$ \frac{\text{Equity}}{\text{Value of Short Position}} < \text{Maintenance Margin}\,.$$

. . .

- This occurs when ABC's price rises, increasing the short-seller's liability.
  - They need to buy the share back in order to return it!


## When does a margin call occur?

- $S_0$ = initial stock value
- $A_0$ = initial assets (short proceeds + margin assets)
- $MM$ = maintenance margin percentage
- $r$ = stock return

. . .

A margin call occurs when:
$$ \frac{A_0 - S_0(1+r)}{S_0(1+r)} < MM\,.$$

. . .

Solving for $r$:
$$ r > \frac{A_0}{S_0(1+MM)} - 1.$$ 

## Margin call example

Initial balance sheet

+-------------------------+--------+--------------------+--------+
| Assets                           | Liab/Eq                     |
+:========================+=======:+:===================+=======:+
| Short Proceeds          |  6,000 | Short ABC          |  6,000 |
| Margin Assets           |  3,000 | Equity             |  3,000 |
+-------------------------+--------+--------------------+--------+
| Total                   |  9,000 | Total              |  9,000 |
+-------------------------+--------+--------------------+--------+

For maintenance margin of 30%, a margin call occurs if stock return is greater than:

$$ \frac{9,000}{6,000(1+0.25)} - 1 = 15.4\%$$


## Relative performance

Sometimes short to bet on **relative** performance.

. . .

Another Example:

- Suppose you are optimistic that Chevron will outperform other energy companies, but not sure what price of oil will do.

. . .

Strategy: buy CVX and short XOM or energy company index (e.g., XLE).


## Example

- Initial capital to invest of $10,000

- Buy $10,000 of CVX and short $10,000 of XOM.

. . .


+---------------+--------+---------------+--------+
| Assets                 | Liab/Eq                |
+:==============+=======:+:==============+=======:+
| CVX           | 10,000 | XOM           | 10,000 |
| Cash          | 10,000 | Equity        | 10,000 |
+---------------+--------+---------------+--------+
| Total         | 20,000 | Total         | 20,000 |
+---------------+--------+---------------+--------+


## Example (cont'd)

Suppose CVX $\uparrow$ 30% and XOM $\uparrow$ 10%

. . .

+---------------+--------+---------------+--------+
| Assets                 | Liab/Eq                |
+:==============+=======:+:==============+=======:+
| CVX           | 13,000 | XOM           | 11,000 |
| Cash          | 10,000 | Equity        | 12,000 |
+---------------+--------+---------------+--------+
| Total         | 23,000 | Total         | 23,000 |
+---------------+--------+---------------+--------+

. . .

The return is 20% (12,000/10,000).

## Stock borrowing fee

- Have to pay stock borrowing fee (usually small).
- Higher for hard to borrow stocks.
- Lending stocks for shorts is a regular business for mutual funds and the like.

## Margin Requirements

- Suppose you have a $100,000 portfolio and you want to add long-short bets like the CVX-XOM example.
- You can add $50,000 long and $50,000 short.
- Fed Reg T: sum of long and short positions cannot exceed twice your equity, when the positions are put on.
- Reg T is for initial margin. Maintenance margin is up to your broker.
- This is a 150/50 portfolio (150% long and 50% short).

## Dividends and interest

- You have to pay the lender dividends paid by the stock.
- Cash proceeds from a short sale are held as collateral.
- How much interest you get on the cash collateral depends on your broker.  Shop around.
