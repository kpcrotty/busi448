# Types of Tax Advantages

<!-- The following is partially based off of Scholes, Wolfson, Erickson, Maydew, and Shevlin's Taxes and Business Strategy text.   -->

## Our benchmark

- We will explore how account taxation can affect the future value of investments.
- Our benchmark will be an investment with no tax advantages in which any gains are taxed immediately at ordinary income rates.

## Some terminology and assumptions

We will assume 2 sets of tax rates:

1. Ordinary income rates $\tau_{oi}$ 
2. Capital gains rates $\tau_{cg}$.  


- We will assume constant tax rates from time $t=0$ to time $t=T-1$ before changing to new rates at time $T$
  - individual's tax brackets may change in somewhat predictable ways

- 4 possible tax rates: $\tau_{oi,0}$, $\tau_{oi,T}$, $\tau_{cg,0}$, $\tau_{cg,T}$.

## Tax Treatment #1

- No tax benefits
- Gains are taxed immediately at ordinary income rates

. . . 

$$FV_1 = \Pi_{t=1}^T \left(1+r_t(1-\tau_{oi,t})\right) \,. $$

- Examples: bank accounts, money market accounts, and non-tax-advantaged bonds

## Tax treatment #2

- Non-deductible IRA
- Contributions are in after-tax dollars
- Taxation on gains is deferred until withdrawal at which time they are taxed as ordinary income

. . . 

$$ \begin{align*}
FV_2 =& \Pi_{t=1}^T (1+r_t) - \tau_{oi,T} \left[\Pi_{t=1}^T (1+r_t) - 1\right] \\
=& (1-\tau_{oi,T})\Pi_{t=1}^T (1+r_t) + \tau_{oi,T}  
\end{align*}
$$

## Tax treatment #3

- Roth IRA or a 529 college savings plan
- Contributions are made using after-tax dollars and earnings are tax-exempt

. . . 

A dollar of after-tax investment turns into $$FV_3 = \Pi_{t=1}^T \left(1+r_t\right) \,. $$


## Tax treatment #4

- Traditional IRA or 401(k)/403(b) retirement plan. 
- Contributions are made using pre-tax dollars (that is, contributions are tax deductible)
- Earnings are tax-deferred $\rightarrow$ withdrawals taxed at ordinary income rates
  - withdrawals of both initial investment and gains

## Tax treatment #4 (cont'd)
- Because the contribution is tax deductible, you save $\tau_{oi,0}$ of taxes that would have otherwise been paid.
- The after-tax cost upon contribution is thus $1-\tau_{oi,0}.$
- The investment account grows to a time $T$ value of $\Pi_{t=1}^T \left(1+r_t\right)$ which is all taxed at withdrawal generating an after-tax time $T$ value of $(1-\tau_{oi,T})\Pi_{t=1}^T \left(1+r_t\right)$.  
- After-tax return (after-tax FV/after-tax contribution): $$FV_4 = \frac{(1-\tau_{oi,T})\Pi_{t=1}^T \left(1+r_t\right)}{1-\tau_{oi,0}}$$

## Traditional vs. Roth IRAs

**If $\tau_{oi,0}=\tau_{oi}$, traditional and Roth IRAs are equivalent on an after-tax basis.**

- Roth IRAs are preferred if an investor's tax rate is expected to be higher at withdrawal.
  - Better to pay taxes at low rate today
- Traditional IRAs are preferred if an investors tax rate is expected to be lower at withdrawl.
  - Better to shield taxes at high rate today


# Asset Location 

## Asset Location

**Asset location** refers to the choice of where to locate different asset classes if different tax-advantaged accounts are available.

- This is a challenging problem!


## TBD...

# For next time: Tax-advantaged Assets
