# CAPM and the Market Model Regression
## What is the CAPM?

- The Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) is a theory from the 1960s.  Its discoverer won the Nobel prize in economics.
- The intuition is:
  - Market risk is the biggest risk that a diversified investor faces.
  - The risk of each asset should be measured in terms of how much it contributes to market risk.
  - The risk premium of each asset should depend (linearly) on this measure of risk.

##  Capital Asset Pricing Model

$$E[r_i - r_f] = \beta_i \cdot E[r_m-r_f]$$

- $E[r_m-r_f]$ is the market risk premium
- $\beta_i = \frac{\text{cov}(r_i, r_m)}{\text{var}(r_m)}$

. . .

Empirically, we estimate a **market model regression**:

$$ r_{i,t} - r_{f,t} = \alpha_i + \beta_i (r_{m,t} - r_{f,t}) + \varepsilon_{i,t} $$

- What differs between the top and bottom equations?




# Theory: CAPM 
## CAPM Assumptions

- Investors have **identical** beliefs about the **same universe** of asset returns
- Investors have **mean-variance** preferences
- **Single period** investment horizon

## CAPM Assumptions

- **Frictionless** borrowing and lending
  - borrowing rate = savings rate
- **Frictionless** trading
  - no transactions costs & no taxation & shorting allowed
- **Perfect competition**: investors are price-takers

## Equilibrium

- All investors view the market portfolio as the tangency portfolio.
- The capital allocation line with respect to the market portfolio is called the **capital market line**
- Investors save or borrow at the risk-free rate to locate on the CML according to their risk aversion.
- Prices will adjust so that the marginal benefit of an asset (its risk premium) is proportional to its marginal contribution to the risk of the *market portfolio*.

## Deriving the CAPM (1/3) {.smaller}

Recall that the tangency portfolio in a frictionless setting satisfies:

\begin{align*}
    \sum_{i=1}^N \text{cov}[r_1,r_i] w_i &= \delta (E[r_1] - r_f) \\
    \sum_{i=1}^N \text{cov}[r_2,r_i] w_i &= \delta (E[r_2] - r_f) \\
    & \vdots \\
    \sum_{i=1}^N \text{cov}[r_N,r_i] w_i &= \delta (E[r_N] - r_f) 
\end{align*}
where $\delta$ is a constant (it is a Lagrange multiplier from the optimization problem)

::: {.nonincremental}
- The LHS terms are the contributions of each asset to overall portfolio risk.  
- The RHS terms are proportional to each asset's risk premium.
:::

## Deriving the CAPM (2/3)  {.smaller}

- Previously: we solved the system for weights
- CAPM: solve for expected returns using market weights

. . .

For asset $j$:
$$ \sum_{i=1}^N \text{cov}[r_j,r_i] w_i = \delta (E[r_j] - r_f) $$

. . . 

Rearrange and use the fact that $r_m = \sum_i w_i r_i$ to get:
$$ E[r_j - r_f] = \delta^{-1} \text{cov}[r_j,r_m] $$

## Deriving the CAPM (3/3) {.smaller}

Using the definition of beta:

$$ E[r_j - r_f] = \delta^{-1} \beta_j \text{var}[r_m]\,. $$

. . . 

Now aggregate this at market weights:

$$ \sum_j w_j \cdot E[r_j - r_f] = \delta^{-1}\text{var}[r_m] \sum_j w_j \cdot \beta_j $$

. . . 

This implies $\delta = \text{var}[r_m] / E[r_m - r_f]$, so we arrive at the CAPM formula:

$$ E[r_j - r_f] = \beta_j E[r_m - r_f] . $$


## Intuition of the equilibium {.smaller}

- The marginal benefit of an asset (its risk premium) is proportional to its marginal contribution to the risk of the *market portfolio*
- The marginal contribution to risk is measured by beta.

. . . 

What if this weren't the case?

- If an asset's reward to risk contribution ratio is higher than ratios for other assets, what would you do?
  - Hold the asset at a greater weight, reducing weights in others.
  - But purchasing would push price up and return down until all investments had the same reward-to-risk-contribution ratio.



# Practice: CAPM 
## CAPM and Corporate Finance

- The CAPM is widely used to estimate expected returns to compute discount factors for corporate investment projects.
  - The return shareholders expect is $r_f + \beta_i \cdot E[r_m-r_f]$.
  - This is the required return on equity capital for corporate projects.
  - aka cost of equity capital

. . .

## CAPM and Investments
  
- The CAPM is somewhat less useful in an investments context.
  - What are the inputs for $r_f$ and $E[r_m-r_f]$?
  - Estimating inputs can be too noisy
  - Doesn't describe the cross-section of equity returns well



## Estimating the market risk premium

- Empirically, this is challenging.

- An additional complication: the MRP is likely time-varying.

## Historical average market risk premium

- One option is to use the **realized** average: $$\frac{1}{T}\sum_t (r_{m,t}-r_{f,t})$$ as an estimate of the **expected** market risk premium
- Sample means are noisy estimates of population means
  - Need a large $T$ sample
  - Precision of estimate doesn't improve with sampling data more frequently.


## Precision of historical average 
- Standard error = SD/$\sqrt{T}$
  - Annual SD of market return of 20%:

```


## The CAPM and cross-sectional data 

- The CAPM doesn't fit realized returns in the cross-section of stocks very well.

- Theoretically, the slope of the SML should be: 
  - $E[r_m-r_f]$
- Empirically, the slope is much flatter than the realized market risk premium.  



## Industry returns example

- A simple example is industry returns. 
- Average returns are mostly unrelated to betas.
