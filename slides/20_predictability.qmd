# Expected returns

## Estimating a stock's expected return

- How should we think about estimating $E[r_i]$?
- Core finance: use CAPM $$ E[r_i]=r_f + \beta_i E[r_{\text{mkt}}-r_f] $$
- But we saw last time that this does poorly empirically
  - as does using historical returns
- Today, we'll discuss some firm characteristics and how they relate to expected returns



# Portfolio sorts
## Sorting stocks

- Consider a characteristic of a firm, like its beta.
- How can we test if high beta firms have high expected returns?
- One method: 
  - sort stocks on betas
  - form portfolios (b/c stock returns are noisy)
  - test if high beta portfolios have higher ex post returns than low beta portfolios



## A litle history on sorting stocks

- Market beta (Black, Jensen, Scholes 1972)
  - If anything, high beta firms *underperform* low beta
- Size (Banz 1981)
  - Small firms outperform large firms
- Book-to-market ratio (Fama-French 1992)
  - High B/M (value) outperform low B/M (growth)

## Is the CAPM dead?

## More history on sorting stocks

- Liquidity (Amihud and Mendelson 1986)
  - less liquid $\rightarrow$ high $r_{t+1}$
- Momentum (Jegadeesh-Titman 1993)
  - past winners beat past losers
- Idiosyncratic volatility (Ang, Hodrick, Xing, Zhang 2006)
  - High `idiovol` $\rightarrow$ low $r_{t+1}$

## Sorting in python

``` {.python}
# Sorting function
def cut_quintiles(x):
    try:
        out = pd.qcut(x, 5, labels=["Lo 20", "Qnt 2", "Qnt 3", "Qnt 4", "Hi 20"])
    except:
        out = pd.Series(np.nan, index=x.index)
    return out
CHAR = 'beta'
df["quintile"] = df.groupby("date")[CHAR].apply(cut_quintiles)    
```


# Cross-sectional regressions

## Cross-sectional regression

- An alternative approach to sorting is a cross-sectional regression

. . .

Regress each stock's average return (a time-series average) on its average characteristic:$$ \overline{r}_{i} = a + b \cdot \text{characteristic}_{i} + e_{i} $$

- If the characteristic is associated with higher returns, $\hat{b}$ should be different from zero!

## Fama-MacBeth

- Characteristics are often time-varying, so it is preferable to use a series of cross-sectional regressions.

. . .

For each time period, run a cross-sectional regression:$$ r_{i,t} = a_t + b_t \cdot \text{characteristic}_{i,t-1} + e_{i,t} $$

- This produces a time-series of coefficients $b_t$.  If the characteristic is associated with higher returns, the time-series average of $\hat{b}_t$ should be different from zero!

## Multivariate Fama-MacBeth

- We can also characterize returns as a linear function of multiple characteristics:

. . .

For each time period, run a cross-sectional regression:$$ r_{i,t} = a_t + b_{1,t} \cdot \text{X1}_{i,t-1} + b_{2,t} \cdot \text{X2}_{i,t-1}+ e_{i,t} $$


## Regressions or sorts?

- Regression restricts the relation between returns and the characteristic to be linear
- Sorting allows for a nonlinear relation across stocks
  - It is more flexible, but it is reassuring if the relation is monotonically increasing or decreasing.
- Recent literature has applied various machine learning techniques to better characterize the cross-section of expected returns.


## Persistence of anomalies

- What should happen as market participants become aware of these results?
- They should trade until the differences disappear.
- Anomalies that do not go away may be compensation for risk and should be accounted for as part of the asset's risk premium $$ E[r] = r_f + \text{risk premium} $$
- More on this next time...
